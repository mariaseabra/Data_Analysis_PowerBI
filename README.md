## Data Analysis and Exploration Project

# Overview

This repository contains the files and documentation for a project completed as part of the "Data Analysis and Exploration" course in the Data Science and Business Analytics postgraduate program at ISEG. The project involved creating a Tabular BI Semantic Model using Microsoft Visual Studio and then building a report using Microsoft Power BI.

# Project Description

The project aimed to utilize a dataset provided by the course instructor to create a Tabular BI Semantic Model and a corresponding Power BI report. The key steps involved in the project were:

Data Importation and Transformation: The dataset was imported into Microsoft Visual Studio, and various data transformation tasks were performed, such as renaming columns, deleting irrelevant columns, applying filters, and reordering columns.

**Model Creation:** Relationships were established between the different tables, and hierarchies and calculated columns were defined to enable better data analysis. Measures and a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) were also created.

**Model Analysis:** The created Tabular BI Semantic Model was analyzed using Microsoft Excel, and a pivot table was generated.

**Perspectives, Partitions, and Roles:** Perspectives, partitions, and roles were defined to enhance the model's flexibility and security.

**Power BI Report:** A Power BI report was created, featuring visualizations and dynamic filters to provide insights into the data.

**Power BI.com and App Creation**: The Power BI report was published to Power BI.com, and a dashboard and app were created to facilitate easy access and sharing of the analysis.

# Repository Structure
The repository contains the following files:

**Power BI Report:** The Power BI report file, which includes the visualizations and insights generated from the Tabular BI Semantic Model.

**Tabular BI Semantic Model:** The files related to the Tabular BI Semantic Model, including the Visual Studio project and the Excel pivot table analysis.
